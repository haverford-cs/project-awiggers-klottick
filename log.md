### 12-4-19 (3 hrs)
* Begin processing data for use in the model:
    * convert all categorical features into numerical ones
    * add final labels
    * remove incomplete examples
    * make team names consistent across csv
### 12-5-19 (2 hrs)
* Complete processing data
    * convert spread to consistently describe home team
    * add "matrix" of wins between teams within season
    * begin setting up neural network
### 12-11-19 (3 hrs)
 * Set up initial model using tensorflow
 * Determine "bookie" accuracy
### 12-12-19 (3 hrs)
* Attempt to determine optimal neural network architecture
* Begin testing best year to start reading in data
* Begin to determine best number of epochs and batch size
### 12-17-19 (12 hrs)
 * Set up power point
 * Finalize model hyperparameters (architecture, batch-size, num -epochs)
 * Fix bookie accuracy to make it go over the same time as our test data
 * Test the data on other models to get comparisons (svm, knn, decision tree)
 * Run many tests
 * Discover that we have omitted a large portion of the data due to a bug in our csv reading code
 *Re-finalize model hyperparameters
 *Generate graphs for powerpoint presentation
